# Natural Voice Enhancement Guide

## What Changed

The audio system has been enhanced to **automatically select the most natural-sounding Indian English female voices** available on your device.

## Voice Selection Priority

The system now selects voices in this order:

1. **Google Indian English (Female)** ⭐ *Best Quality*
2. **Google Indian English (Any)**
3. **System Indian English (Non-Microsoft)**
4. **Google English (Any accent)**
5. **Fallback to first available**

## Why Google Voices Sound Better

- **Google voices** use neural TTS technology and sound much more natural
- **Microsoft voices** tend to be more robotic
- **System voices** (macOS/iOS) vary in quality
