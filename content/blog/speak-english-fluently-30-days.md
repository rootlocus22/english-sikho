"I can understand English, but I get stuck when I try to speak."

If this sounds like you, you have a **fluency gap**. Your passive vocabulary (reading/listening) is high, but your active vocabulary (speaking) is low.

The good news? You can close this gap in 30 days.

## The 30-Day Fluency Framework

### Week 1: Shadowing (The Copycat Method)
Babies learn by copying. You should too.
*   **Action:** Listen to a native speaker (podcast/YouTube) for 5 minutes.
*   **Task:** Repeat exactly what they say, matching their speed and pause.
*   **Tool:** Use EnglishGyani's **"Listen"** button on translations to hear perfect pronunciation.

### Week 2: Think in English
Stop translating from Hindi/Tamil/Marathi in your head.
*   **Action:** Narrate your day. "I am making tea. The water is boiling."
*   **Task:** Do this for 10 minutes daily.
*   **Tip:** If you don't know a word, don't switch to your mother tongue. Describe it in English.

### Week 3: The Mirror Technique
*   **Action:** Stand in front of a mirror.
*   **Task:** Speak on a topic for 2 minutes without stopping.
*   **Topic Ideas:** My favorite movie, why I want this job, my dream vacation.

### Week 4: Real Conversations (The AI Advantage)
You need feedback. But real tutors are expensive ($15/hour) and judgmental.

**Better Solution:** Practice with AI.
*   **Action:** Use the **EnglishGyani Practice Gym**.
*   **Task:** Roleplay a job interview or a coffee chat.
*   **Benefit:** The AI replies instantly with voice, and it never judges your mistakes.

## Why Most People Fail
They focus on grammar rules (Active Voice/Passive Voice) instead of **speaking**.

You don't learn to ride a bike by reading physics books. You learn by riding.
