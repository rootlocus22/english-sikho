Nervous about your next interview? It's usually not the *coding* or the *skills* that scare you—it's the English.

Here are the most common questions and how to answer them without fumbling.

## 1. "Tell me about yourself."
**Don't say:** "My name is Rahul. I am from Delhi. My father is..."
**Do say:** "I am a software engineer with 4 years of experience specializing in backend development. Currently, I work at TechCorp where I lead the API integration team. I am passionate about scalable systems and am looking for a challenging role in fintech."

## 2. "Why do you want to join us?"
**Don't say:** "I need a job and salary is good."
**Do say:** "I have followed your company's growth in the AI sector for years. I am particularly impressed by your recent product launch. I believe my skills in Python and machine learning would be a great fit for your engineering team."

## 3. "What are your weaknesses?"
**Don't say:** "I have no weakness" or "I work too hard."
**Do say:** "I sometimes struggle with public speaking. However, I am actively working on it by taking online courses and practicing in team meetings to improve my confidence."

## 4. "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
