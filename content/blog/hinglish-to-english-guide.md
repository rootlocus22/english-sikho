Are you still asking your clients to "do the needful"? Or telling your boss you will "revert back"?

If you are working with international clients or in a top-tier Indian MNC, these "Hinglish" phrases might be holding your career back. While they are perfectly understood in India, they can sound confusing or even unprofessional to global ears.

In this guide, we'll transform your everyday Hinglish into polished, professional Corporate English.

## What is Hinglish?

Hinglish is a blend of Hindi and English. It's the colorful, expressive language of the Indian streets and offices. But in a formal business setting, clarity is king.

### The Most Common Hinglish Phrases (And What to Say Instead)

Here are the top offenders we see in Indian corporate emails daily:

#### 1. "Do the needful"
**Why it's a problem:** It sounds archaic and slightly demanding to Western speakers.
**Better Alternative:** 
*   "Please do what is necessary."
*   "Please take the appropriate action."
*   "Could you please look into this?"

#### 2. "Revert back"
**Why it's a problem:** 'Revert' means to go back to a previous state. 'Back' is redundant. It's like saying "return back".
**Better Alternative:**
*   "I will reply soon."
*   "I will get back to you."
*   "Please respond by Tuesday."

#### 3. "Prepone"
**Why it's a problem:** This word doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries (though it's very logical!).
**Better Alternative:**
*   "Can we bring the meeting forward?"
*   "Can we schedule the meeting earlier?"

#### 4. "I have a doubt"
**Why it's a problem:** In English, 'doubt' implies suspicion or lack of belief. You likely just have a question.
**Better Alternative:**
*   "I have a question."
*   "I have a query regarding this point."

## Why This Matters for Your Career

Your communication skills are often the first thing people notice.
