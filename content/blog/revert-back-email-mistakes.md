Words matter. In a remote work world, your email *is* your personality. If your email is full of redundancies and errors, you look careless.

Here are the 7 deadly sins of Indian corporate emails.

## 1. "Revert Back" / "Reply Back"
**The Error:** Redundancy. 'Revert' means to go back. 'Back' is unnecessary.
**Fix:** Just say "Revert" or "Reply".
*   *Wrong:* "Please revert back by evening."
*   *Right:* "Please reply by evening."

## 2. "Myself [Name]"
**The Error:** Grammatically incorrect introduction.
**Fix:** "I am [Name]" or "My name is [Name]".
*   *Wrong:* "Myself Rahul from Accounts."
*   *Right:* "I am Rahul from Accounts."

## 3. "PFA attached"
**The Error:** PFA stands for "Please Find Attached". Adding "attached" again is repetitive.
**Fix:** "PFA the report" or "Please find the report attached."

## 4. "Discuss about"
**The Error:** 'Discuss' implies talking *about* something. 'About' is redundant.
**Fix:** "Let's discuss the project."
*   *Wrong:* "We need to discuss about the budget."
*   *Right:* "We need to discuss the budget."

## 5. Using ALL CAPS
**The Error:** It looks like you are YELLING.
**Fix:** Use bold for emphasis, never all caps.
*   *Wrong:* "PLEASE SUBMIT TODAY."
*   *Right:* "Please submit **today**."

## 6. "One of the friend"
**The Error:** Subject-verb agreement. It must be plural.
**Fix:** "One of my friends." (One from the group of friends).

## 7. Informality with Seniors
**The Error:** "Hey [Name]" or "Hi [Name]" to a very senior person you don't know well.
**Fix:** Stick to "Dear [Name]" until you have a closer relationship.
